This Repo contains train, test dataset and my approach to the PS of flipr-hackathon. Training set - 10k points Test set - 14.5k points

PS: Given several info. about a person, predict the probability that he will be infected by the COVID-19 virus.

My Approach: I have tried implementing various conventional ML algorithms  to predict the probability and then used the best-one (based on MSE & MAE) for the final prediction. I have implemented ARIMA forecasting method for predicting a feature(Diuresis rate) on 8th day by using it's given data for each day,each patient id on 7 days.
